# AirBnB Clone v4

This project is an implementation of the AirBnB clone with dynamic web features. It aims to provide a platform where users can search for rental properties and filter them based on various criteria.

## Authors
- Paschal Ugwu
- Amarachi Nnanta

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:
- Requesting your own API
- Modifying HTML element styles and content
- Manipulating the DOM
- Making GET and POST requests with JQuery Ajax
- Listening/binding to DOM and user events

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code interpreted on Chrome (version 57.0)
- All files end with a new line
- Semistandard compliant code (`semistandard *.js --global $`)
- All JavaScript in the `scripts` folder
- JQuery version 3.x must be used
- Avoid using `var`
- HTML should not reload for each action
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder

### GitHub
- One project repository per group
- Cloning/forking a repository with the same name before the second deadline results in a 0% score

### Before Starting the Project
Ensure you have Flasgger installed locally:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-lxml
$ sudo pip3 install flask_cors
$ sudo pip3 install flasgger
```
Troubleshoot potential dependencies issues if the RestAPI is not starting.

### Manual QA Review
Request a review from a peer before the project's deadline.
